<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About This Project

This project is part of a the job interview process at the University of Ottawa's Engineering Outreach Department. My submission will only include this year's front-end challenge. For any curious minds who'd like to see more about the back-end challenge, feel free to take a look at the [About](About.md) file in this repository. It's a duplicate of the challenge's README. You can also view the full challenge repository (the one from which this one is forked) [here](https://github.com/AES-Outreach/Fall-2021-Interview).

A note for anybody from the OutStem team (or anybody else) who may be reading this down the line: this project is my first time using JavaScript and React. I'm very interested in product design and front-end development, and for that reason, even though it isn't my background, I wanted to challenge myself with this task. A lot of this is going to be me experimenting and trying to figure my way out around JS development for the first time, so, *full disclosure*, it's going to be a bit hacky.
