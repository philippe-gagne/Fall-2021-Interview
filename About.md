<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Challenge

There are two parts to the challenge this year - [a front-end challenge](/FRONTEND) and a [back-end challenge](/BACKEND). You only need to do **one** of them, but if you would like, consider implementing both challenges as part of a full stack application.

Both challenges are designed to check you ability to apply technologies in the real world by building a functional application. Please note that we are only looking for effort, and that the challenge result is just a part of our discussion with you during the interview so don't worry if your solution is *hacky* or even if it doesn't work, submit it anyways, we want to see it!

For the front-end challenge, you are tasked to build an authentication UI by replicate a mock up design. 

For the back-end challenge, you are tasked to build a URL shortening API.

You are allowed to use any technology you prefer for both challenges, with the only caveat being the end result for the front-end challenge must run on a browser. You can use any framework, library you like for both challenges.

The challenge is due **May 24th 11:59pm**. Your submission can be done via GitHub pull request or GitHub issues, more details about submission can be found in the individual challenge README files.

Good luck and have fun!
